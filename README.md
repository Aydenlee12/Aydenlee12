- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aydenlee12
- 👀 I'm interested in the intersection of coding and electronics, particularly how software can control and enhance hardware functionality.
- Learning about algorithms, sensors, and data communication further fuels my passion, as I strive to create seamless interactions between software and the physical world.

- 🌱I’m currently attending the University of Augsburg, majoring in computer science. Right now, I'm learning about data structures and Python, which has been really engaging. In the near future, I hope to dive into algorithms and JavaScript to expand my skills further.
- I’m excited about how these concepts will enhance my understanding of coding and its applications in software development."

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help me build connections within the tech community, where I can share ideas and learn from others.
- I believe that these connections are essential for growth and innovation. Additionally, I'm eager to secure an internship that allows me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, gain practical experience, and contribute to exciting projects in software development.
- I’m passionate about working with others who share similar interests and are enthusiastic about pushing the boundaries of technology.
